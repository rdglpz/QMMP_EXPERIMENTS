**README**

This MATLAB code has been tested in MATLAB2017b 64-bit (win64).

To produce the QMMP+, Cal, NN and Naive results, please copy the content of the folder "metaModel_prediction_for_demand_forecast_in_WDN Experiments" in any location in the hard disk and run the main-MultiModelPrediction.m

This code generates: 

1. The m', m and epsilon columns of Table 1. Sarima Structures for each time series.
2. The QMMP+, Cal, NN and Naive columns of Table 2 to 4 reporting MAE, RMSE and MAPE.
3. The QMMP+, Cal, NN and Naive individual variances of Table 5.
